Change the database connection settings in the Settings.php file and you should be good to go!



Project Vision

My goal is to create an anonymous bulletin board where you can post links or simple comments. I may also implement that you can
post pictures that shows directly in the post but I'm not sure if I'll leave this out and just keep links to images instead.
The vision is that people can share links to songs/videos or articles in different categories (like music and video games).
If I have time I may implement some sort of voting system where posts can be voted and can be viewed from lowest voted or highest voted.

Test Cases:
Post:
* The user should be able to create a post and the post will be saved to the database.
* The user can choose to create posts in different categories
* The user can post links without them being removed or failing validation
* The user can't be able to post html tags (js injections and stuff)

View:
* The user can view all posts.
* The user can view posts from a certain category.
* The user can view replies to posts.

Reply:
* The user can reply to a post.

Result:
I didn't have time to implement all the things I wanted (maybe pictures and voting system) but I had time to make all the basic functionality I wanted, such as posting, viewing different categories, replying etc. It's a simple project that still required quite a bit of time to put together so I'm fine with it lacking some of the extra things I had in mind.
